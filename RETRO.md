# Mini Retro with me, myself and I


## What went well

From the beginning I had a very strong mindset about keeping to the brief and scope as close as possible. This is my personal opinion, but as a developer I find that it is easy for me to get carried away and start adding in 'nice to have' features... It's a double edge sword really, but for the purpose of this challenge I needed to stay within scope and deliver according the the specs and brief. Overall, I am happy with the end result, I kept it simple. K.I.S.S.

## Improvements

One of my challenges of was time spent debugging. A Test Driven Development (TDD)approach would have minimize the time spent debugging, I was just so excited to see the Robot do its thing. 

A TDD approach would surely mean slower development, however it gives validation and assurance that the code works as intended. Thinking about it now after completing the challenge, putting in and removing all those console logs/tables was probably more time constly than if I took the TDD approach. 

This does not only apply to this challenge and future challenges, but my journey as a developer. TDD is definetly a practice and mindset I will continue to persue, sometimes we need to hit the brakes and go back to taking baby steps so that silly mistakes are avoided and the higest quality is achieved.

## Learnings and take-aways:

Taking this challenge gave me a deeper understanding of:

```this```

```prototype```

## The 'nice to haves' I spoke about earlier...

I would love to have a more visual representation, that way it could feel that the Robot is somewhat actaully responding:

- A visible table/grid.
- A visible representation/indication of the robot.
- Make everything look prettier with colors.
